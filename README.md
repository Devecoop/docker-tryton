# Tryton docker

This repo contains the base Dockerfiles to build tryton docker
images. To build all the images just do:

```$ ./build.sh```

Although, if you want to start a tryton project (using docker with
argentine localization modules) we recommend to use
https://github.com/Devecoop/tryton-project
